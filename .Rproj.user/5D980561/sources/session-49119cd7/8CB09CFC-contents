This research investigates substance use patterns and overdose dynamics to inform prevention and intervention strategies. First, we analyze short-term spikes in fatal overdoses using Massachusetts vital statistics, identifying critical periods where deaths surge beyond expected trends. Our findings highlight the need for real-time monitoring to mitigate sudden overdose clusters. Second, we explore the role of specific substances in overdose spikes at the state and county levels, revealing substantial geographic heterogeneity in drug involvement, emphasizing the need for localized public health responses. Third, we assess early alcohol use progression among preadolescents using ABCD data, identifying family and environmental influences that accelerate the transition from experimentation to initiation. Lastly, we examine longitudinal substance use patterns in early adolescence, uncovering increasing multi-substance use trajectories and sociodemographic disparities. Together, these studies offer a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing substance abuse, with implications for timely interventions and policy development.
