abstract: "Objectives:Yearly rolling aggregate trends or rates are commonly used to analyze trends in overdose deaths, but focusing on long-term trends can obscure short-term fluctuations (eg, daily spikes). We analyzed data on spikes in daily fatal overdoses and how various spike detection thresholds influence the identification of spikes.Materials and Methods: We used a spike detection algorithm to identify spikes among 16 660 drug-related overdose deaths (from any drug) reported in Massachusettsâ€™ vital statistics from 2017 through 2023. We adjusted the parameters of the algorithm to define spikes in 3 distinct scenarios: deaths exceeding 2 adjusted moving SDs above the 7-, 30-, and 90-day adjusted moving average. Results: Our results confirmed the on-the-ground observation that there are days when many more people die of overdoses than would be expected based on fluctuations due to differences among people alone. We identified spikes on 5.8 percent to 20.6 percent of the days across the 3 scenarios, annually, constituting 11.1 percent to 31.6 percent of all overdose deaths. The absolute difference in percentage points of days identified as spikes varied from 5.2 to 11.5 between 7- and 30-day lags and from 0 to 4.6 between 30- and 90-day lags across years. When compared with the adjusted moving average across the 3 scenarios, in 2017 an average of 3.9 to 5.5 additional deaths occurred on spike days, while in 2023 the range was 3.7 to 6.0.Practice Implications: A substantial percentage of deaths occurred annually on spike days, highlighting the need for effectively monitoring short-term overdose trends. Moreover, our study serves as a foundational analysis for future research into exogenous events that may contribute to spikes in overdose deaths, aiming to prevent future deaths."
