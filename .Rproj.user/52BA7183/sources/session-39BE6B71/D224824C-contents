My research interests are generally in the area of operations research and, more specifically, in the area of stochastic models and stochastic dynamic programming with applications to service systems, including health systems and revenue management. My dissertation research is in the area of data-driven models for improving decision-making in the context of cardiovascular disease, with the help of clinical collaborators at the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. I am currently analyzing longitudinal electronic medical record data and pharmacy claims data to optimize appointment follow-up policies for patients. My goal is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

I am an active member of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), and I currently serve as the Past-President of the [INFORMS student chapter at the University of Michigan](https://informs.engin.umich.edu/).

Academic advisors:

[Brian T. Denton, Ph.D.](https://btdenton.engin.umich.edu/) and [Mariel S. Lavieri, Ph.D.](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lavieri/)
